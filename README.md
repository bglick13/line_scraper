TODO:
Create a separate project and deploy to Heroku. Should implement Plotly Auth first.

If delayed quotes are causing problems, we could instead calculate the cutoff for what qualifies a betting opportunity and actively monitor the betting sites. Of course, this still depends on the quotes more or less being accurate to calculate the cutoffs, but it at least aggregates the error.

Ideally, obviously, we'd find a better solution to live line updates. Don Best seems like a good, albeit expensive solution. If this strategy proves to work, it is probably worth the investment.
